   The user of this template must understand that
it is the responsibility of the student to
meet the formatting requirements set down in the 
``University of Missouri-Kansas City  Guide to 
Formatting Theses and Dissertations.''
Following this  template does not guarantee
acceptance by the School of Graduate Studies. 

   When preparing the abstract, follow carefully the 
directions in the ``Guide to Formatting Graduate Theses 
and Dissertations.''
In addition, use the form illustrated in this 
sample. The type of information shown at the top of 
the page and at the end of the abstract is
included in all abstracts.  The spacing and capitalization
must be observed. 

Center horizontally the information at 
the top: (1) the title; (2) the author's name and the degree 
to be received; (3) University of Missouri-Kansas City, year; 
and (4)  {ABSTRACT}.  Begin typing the title 
on the 12th line.  The title, in all capitals, is 
set in two lines (or more) if it is longer 
than 48 spaces; use inverted pyramid style and 
double-space.  Triple-space between the title and the 
author's name.  Initial letters only are capitalized
in typing the author's name and the degree.
Double-space before adding the ``University 
of Missouri-Kansas City.'' Triple-space 
before and after ``ABSTRACT.''  

    Triple-space following the text of 
the abstract.  Then add the sentence exactly as show below, 
except, of course, change, the 000 to the approximate number 
of words in the abstract. The final information is the 
name and signature of the professor in charge of the 
thesis (dissertation).  Type the name 
of the professor below the signature line.
