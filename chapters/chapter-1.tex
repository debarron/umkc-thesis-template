\chapter{INTRODUCTION}


Internet was designed for transmitting data  from point A to point B as a best effort scheme. After almost 40 years, the core design of the Internet remains the same, but the demands of the Internet usage have been drastically changed. Future Internet design is a hot area of research today as researchers try to understand the dynamics and demands of todays' Internet and predict the demands of future Internet thereby proposing novel framework and protocols that meet those demands. 
Today Internet relies heavily on the inter-domain routing to make communications happen on the Internet. The most popular inter-domain routing protocol is the Border Gateway Protocol. Another protocol in  the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) world is Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI). PNNI is a hierarchical state-of-art routing protocol and is known to use Quality-of-Service sensitive routing scheme by advertising topology state parameters and Call Admission Control \cite{pnni} .
