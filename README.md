## Compile the dissertation
Alright, now let's see how it's done. Use a Makefile to build the document. Be sure to to set the rigth latex compiler, before running
the following command. Currently Makefile uses pdflatex compiler. Feel free to change the latex compiler if you need a different compiler than pdflatex. 
To build the thesis run:

`make all`

If there were no errors during the compilation process, you'll get **dissertation.pdf** document created in the current directory.
